# CoocoxToMakeFile

I been using Coox recently, as result of the closure of the developer of this app. I was left with a couple of Arm projects with out the posibilty of being used outside this tool.

This tool tries to gatter the most information from the IDE and based on this creates a make file (Please note I imported a project without a glich, the second project found problems because the IDE put the files in a different location)

Please use this tool as first part (modifying the make file is easy)

Thanks
